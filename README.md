**Note:** This repsitory is for python programs created for ademic purposes only.

Repository Consist of Two Programs created for CSC500-1 Module 5:
- **#1 Rainfall Calculator**
- **#2 Book Club Award Points Calculator**
  
**#1 Rainfall Calculator:**
The program serves as a calculator to determine the average rainfall for a given number of years when provided with the rainfall amounts for each month within the year. 

**Start Here: Install & Run**
1.	Clone/Download the repository: Mod4.py script 
2.	Open the mod5_rainfall.py file in Python
•	Link to free online python platform: Online Python - IDE, Editor, Compiler, Interpreter (online-python.com)
3.	Follow the on-screen program instructions

**Lets Go: Using the Program**
1.	The program will prompt you to enter in the number of years you wish to calculate the average rainfall per month for. 
i.	Enter Number of Years
2.	Next, the program will:
   i.	Go through each month (1 - 12 | Jan - Dec) in a year and ask user to enter in the amount of rainfall in inches (ok to use decimal numbers).
   ii.	Loop the above monthly collection for the number of times that equals the total years that the user entered at start.
3.	Calculations:
   i.	Calculates total rainfall entered in by user for all months/years.
   ii.	Calculates total months of rainfall data (years*12)
   iii.	Calculates monthly rainfall average: divides total rainfall by total months
4.	Program will automatically give user output of information:
   i.	Total Rainfall
   ii.	Total Months
   iii.	Average Rainfall per Month
   
**Check it Out: The Features**
1.	Display:  Graphically divides each Year so the user easily knows when they are entering data for a new year.
2.	Nested If/Then: Uses nested if/then statements to determine whether to proceed, return error, or calculate.
3.	Calculate: Calculates using addition, multiplication, and division.
4.	Results: Presents results in nice summary display.

**#2 Book Club Award Points Calculator**
In this python program we are calculating the number of award points using nested conditional statements. The program asks the user to input the number of books purchased in a month and then calculates the total award points earned based on nested if/then logic. 

**Install & Run**
1.	Download the python file from the GitHub repository: Mod4.py script 
2.	Open the downloaded  file in Python (link above for free online version)
3.	Follow the on-screen program instructions.

**Using the Program**
1.	The program will first ask the user to indicate how many books they purchased this month. 
   i.	User Input = number of books
2.	The program will then go through nested If/then/elif Logic to find the number of points the user has earned based on the number of books. 
   i.	This includes combined single ‘and’ clauses to allow the number of books to be within an range in order to determine the points earned.
3.	Last, the program will print the output to the user and give exit options:
   i.	Total award points earned.
   ii.	Message to motivate user to earn more points.
   iii.	Exit options (e to exit r to restart)

**Features**
1.	Logic: Uses conditional expressions by converting each if-else statement into a single assignment statement..
2.	Results: Displays the points earned and gives a motivational message to user.
3.	Exit Menu: Allows user to easily restart or exit application.
